      <!--Story Mode-->
      <h2>Part 1: Enter the 36 Costcos</h2>
      <p>The year is 2021. The second wave of SARS-COV-2 brought on a second wave of panic buying. Due to understocked product and the government taking the sardonic comment of an intern seriously, a new program was put in place to solve the issue: a battle royale.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The rules are simple: a small group of six shoppers are let into the Costco, and they have to fight eachother for the
      supplies. The last survivor gets to walk home.
      This new rule ended up killing thousands of Americans within the first month alone. But our hero, Pete Buffley, and his toddler, Hans(he's adopted), are determined to go home with the loot.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>There will be blood.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>You and Hans enter the Costco, ready to fight for your supplies. The costco workers all wish you good luck, hand you a cart, and send you on your way. Which way shall you go?</p>


      <div id="space1-1">
        <ul>
          <li>You and Hans are in the freezer section. A hoarder shuts the door and locks you in with them.</li>
          <li>You see a roll of toilet paper resting on the pile of lettuce bags.</li>
          <li>"You want the toilet paper? Lettuce fight for it," you quip, raising your fists.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="space1-2">
        <ul>
          <li>You and Hans head to the meat section.</li>
          <li>"Nice to meat you, traveler," a Costco employee says.</li>
          <li>You have acquired the Meat.</li>
        </ul>

      <div id="space1-3">
        <ul>
          <li>You and Hans find yourselves in the food aisle, face-to-face with a rabid shopper.</li>
          <li>A roll of toilet paper lays in their cart. You NEED toilet paper.</li>
          <li>The shopper growls at you. You are ready to fight them.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>You and Hans are in the toilet paper aisle.</li>
          <li>To your dismay but to no surprise, all the toilet paper is gone; where the paper should be is replaced by a bulletin board with missing person posters and memorials.</li>
