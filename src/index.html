<h1>Costco Royale</h1>
<h2>Part 1: Enter the 36 Costcos</h2>
<p>The year is 2021. The second wave of SARS-COV-2 brought on a second wave of panic buying. Due to understocked product and the government taking the sardonic comment of an intern seriously, a new program was put in place to solve the issue: a battle rayale.</p>
<br>
<p>The rules are simple: a small group of six shoppers are let into the Costco, and they have to fight eachother for the
  supplies. The last survivor gets to walk home.
This new rule ended up killing thousands of Americans within the first month alone. But our hero, Pete Buffley, and his toddler, Hans(he's adopted), are determined to go home with the loot.

<br>
<p>There will be blood.</p>
